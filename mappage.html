                    <p>The Uffizi Gallery (or Galleria degli Uffizi), is one of the oldest and most celebrated art museums in Europe. It is located in the Palazzo degli Uffizi, in Florence, Italy - the home of the European Renaissance. As one might expect from the foremost museum of Renaissance art in Florence, its collection of masterpieces from the Early and High Renaissance eras, begun by the powerful Medici family, later enlarged by the Lorraine Grand Dukes and completed by the Italian State authorities, is second to none. </p>
                    <p>It also includes other important collections, notably the Contini Bonacossi Collection and the Collection of Prints and Drawings (Gabinetto Disegni e Stampe degli Uffizi). The Uffizi has been open to visitors since the late 16th century, and was officially opened to the public in 1765.</p>

                        The Pitti Palace (Palazzo Pitti), one of the best art museums in Europe, is a former residence of the King of Italy. Today it houses many different types of art, including several important collections of paintings, sculpture, porcelain and historical costumes, and is renowned for its beautiful Renaissance art and chitecture. It is situated in an historical part of Florence and the grounds extend to the Boboli Gardens, which in itself is famous for its grottoes, statues and fountains.

                    <p>
                        The Palace is located south of the River Arno, a short walk from Ponte Vecchio. The main part of the building dates from 1458 when it was originally occupied by a local Florentine banker. It was bought by the Medici family in 1549 and became the chief residence of Tuscany's ruling families for centuries. As the building was added to, so were its collections of fine art, and decorative art. In the 18th century it was used a powerbase by Napoleon and briefly served as a residence for the Royal family of a newly united Italy.

                        In 1919 the palace and its contents were donated to the people of Italy by King Victor Emmanuel III. It is one of Florence's largest art galleries.

                    <p>One of the best art museums in Europe, the National Museum of Capodimonte (Museo Nazionale di Capodimonte) is located in the grand Palace of Capodimonte in Naples. Its exquisite collection of artworks includes many different types of art but focuses primarily on painting and decorative art from Naples, but also includes examples from most Italian schools of painting and some sculpture from antiquity. </p>
                    <p>The origins of the Capodimonte museum date back to 1738, when King Charles VII of Naples (later King Charles III of Spain) decided to build a hunting lodge on Capodimonte hill, but then decided instead to make it a palace; partly to accommodate his expanding court but also to house the Farnese art collection which he had inherited from his mother, Elisabetta Farnese. Over time the palace was extended, as was the art collection.</p>
                    <p>Today, the core of the collection still derives from the Farnese and Bourbon dynasties. The gallery’s large holding of portrait art comes mostly from the Farnese collection. It includes portraits by Titian (c.1485-1576), Sebastiano del Piombo (1485-1547) and Lorenzo Lotto (c.1480–1556), as well as the Mannerist Rosso Fiorentino (1494–1540). The Bourbon collection includes portraits by Neoclassical painter Angelica Kauffmann (1741-1807), the Sant'Eufemia (1454) sculpture by Andrea Mantegna (1431–1506) and The Holy Family by Palma the Elder (1480–1528).</p>
